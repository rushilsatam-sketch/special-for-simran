      <h2>My Dearest ❤️</h2>
      <p>
        From the moment I first saw you in the computer lab on 21st October 2024 💻✨, something in me changed. That very day, I knew you were the one 💘. Since then, every moment with you has been nothing short of magical 🌸🌟.<br><br>

        You’ve made me feel special in ways no one ever has before 🥰. You understand me, even when I don’t say a word 🤫💞. Yes, we’ve had our little fights over silly reasons 😅💢, but through it all, my love for you has only grown deeper ❤️🔥.<br><br>

        I’m sorry for the trouble I sometimes give you 😔🙏. I haven’t met anyone like you who keeps me so close 🤗💖 and makes me feel so comfortable sharing everything with you 🥹💌. Being with you feels natural, safe, and incredibly special 💕🌈.<br><br>

        I don’t know where the future will take us 🌍❓, but what I do know is that right now, in this moment, I want to cherish every second with you ⏳💞. I want us to create memories so beautiful that we’ll carry them forever in our hearts 🌸💫.<br><br>

        Happy Birthday, Simran 🎉🎂💖! May all your dreams come true ✨🌈, and may life give you everything you wish for 🌟💝. Seeing you happy makes me the happiest person in the world 🥰💞.<br><br>

        You will always be everything to me, Simran 💝. Every minute spent with you fills my heart with happiness 🥰❤️. I love you more than words can ever say 💖💌💫.
